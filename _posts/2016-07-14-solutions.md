## Consulting

### Rho puts experience to work for your organization

Clinical trials involve a myriad of complicated processes and variables. Rho can help you navigate the clinical trial process to save you time and minimize costs. Each client benefits from our years of expert support of the world's leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as the [National Institutes of Health][0] and other federal agencies.

### Rho's CRO consulting services

**Protocol design**

We consider elements of the protocol and how they will shape the requirements for executing the trial. We instill expertise into each protocol we craft, priding ourselves on enhancing the ease of execution, delivering the science, and taking site operations into account. Our efficient process ensures that your protocol is finished on or ahead of schedule.

**Clinical regulatory support**

Our clinical regulatory experts can serve as resources to create protocols that can be finalized quickly and supported by sites so that studies run on time or even ahead of schedule. We provide investigational new drug (IND) and new drug application (NDA) support and guide the client through each step of the process: providing expert advice, planning meetings, preparing pre-meeting briefing packages, and facilitating communication with regulatory agencies.

**Statistical support**

Our highly qualified professionals can critique existing protocols or publications describing completed clinical studies. Our scientists develop simulations and conduct ad-hoc analyses to investigate underlying assumptions or study results. We can then package our results as responses to regulators' questions. Our statisticians design adaptive trials and confirm the approach with the FDA.

**Submissions regulatory support**

We can also provide our clients with comprehensive and integrated strategic regulatory consulting and [submission services][1] from [early phase development][2] through [post-marketing activities][3], including life cycle management of pharmaceuticals, biologics, and devices.

**Data standards**

Our experts understand a wide range of industry [data standards][4] and apply them to the needs of individual studies. Our skill at supporting and working with such a range of data standards maximizes our ability to meet our clients' goals.

### We can help you find the right Rho expert to meet your needs

If the scientists who are designing your clinical program could benefit from Rho's clinical trial experience, [contact us][5]. We have the expertise to guide you in the right direction.

## Functional Service Provider (FSP) Model

FSP partnerships have been gaining traction in recent years because of their potential for increasing efficiency in outsourcing without compromising quality. At Rho, we have been supporting sponsors in this model since before it had an acronym. We understand the common hurdles in this model and how to avoid them. We have implemented a number of FSP models and can reduce your timelines and costs without compromising scientific integrity or quality. We know how to make FSP work.

#### Rho offers FSP services in the following areas:

* [Biostatistics and statistical programming][6]
* [Data standards and CDISC][4]
* [Data management][7]
* [Regulatory and medical writing][8]

#### Benefits of an FSP model with Rho:

**An extension of your team:** Work with a consistent team that understands your systems, your processes, and your expectations.

**Flexibility & scalability:** Our FSP model provides an easy and flexible way to scale up and avoid the expense of underutilized resources.

**Industry leading expertise:** Benefit from the knowledge and experience of our industry leading experts in biostatistics, data standards, and regulatory and medical writing.

**Tapered oversight over time: **Reduce the amount of time and energy spent on oversight as our working relationship matures.

**Open communication: **Better long-term planning and availability results in faster turnaround times.

**Cultural fit: **We seek to partner with Sponsor companies that are a good "fit." Strong relationships are critical to making FSP programs work.

## Phase II/III Clinical Trial Management

### Rho's experience advances Phase II and Phase III trial management

Rho is adept at managing every aspect of Phase II and Phase III trials. We offer a broad range of services that allows us to provide capacity and experience in clinical trial management.

**Clinical operations provides experience and leadership at each site**

The value of Rho's [Clinical Operations][9] lies in the experience we bring to the client. As a result, we can provide strong site management and enrollment strategies. We consider the Lead Clinical Research Associate (LCRA) to be an integral part of the study---that's why ours have an average of 5 to 10 years of clinical operations leadership experience. Our non-regional CRA model allows our CRAs to develop expertise within therapeutic areas, become more closely integrated with the rest of the project team, and focus on a smaller number of protocols.

**Medical monitoring services with a focus on safety**

Rho's Medical Monitors are a vital component to Phase II and Phase III clinical trial success. [Medical monitoring][10] plays an important role in providing protection to research subjects, integrity of results, and consistency of protocol. Our team of Medical Monitors is composed of an on-board staff and network of specialist physicians that guide study teams through the issues faced in clinical research studies.

**Robust statistical services and advice**

Our creative [statisticians][6] design small yet flexible Phase II studies. We critically review Phase II results, investigate data accuracy, and conduct power analyses when designing larger Phase III studies. Our statisticians support data and safety monitoring boards (DSMBs) and conduct interim analyses. Because timing is so critical in these phases of development, our counsel can help you make timely and informed decisions about sample sizes and doses, which will guide your program development.

**Clinical data management capacity**

Phase II and Phase III studies require strong capabilities to handle a large volume of sites, subjects, and case report forms (eCRFs or CRFs). Rho delivers the [clinical data management][7] capacity necessary for these vital phases of development. We've demonstrated this strength in successfully completed projects with hundreds of sites and thousands of subjects.
