Andrew works closely with study sites as a CRA. He ensures site compliance with FDA regulations and GCP requirements and reviews source documents and CRFs to verify the integrity of clinical data. He currently supports several multi-site research studies as the primary on-site monitor. When he's not traveling between clinical sites, Andrew enjoys the outdoors, whether it's hiking with his wife and dog, playing basketball and golf, or grilling out with friends.

## Meet Heidi

Heidi's love for cooking and bacon go hand in hand. She once had a birthday party that revolved solely around bacon; serving at least 30 pounds of it in a variety of dishes. If she had to pick her favorite dish to make, it would be Asian pork belly sliders. Rho employees always look forward to Heidi's gourmet dishes at company potlucks and cooking competitions. When she's not whipping up something in the kitchen, she's a Senior Software Test Engineer, specializing in EDC. Heidi supports several Rho applications and third party vendors, builds clinical databases, and assists with the creation, training, and implementation of data management plans, guidelines, and study documents.

Spencer grew up in South Carolina and attended college there, thus cementing his love for the South. Warm weather, fantasy football, ping pong, and music are a few of Spencer's interests. Throughout the day, you'll find him on Rho's outdoor walking trail or burning up the ping pong table in the game room. Back at his desk, Spencer's primary focus as a Senior Statistical Programmer, is programming tables, listings, and figures, developing data check tools to help clean data and lock databases, and working in SAS and d3 (a JavaScript library for data visualization). You may also run into Spencer presenting at RTSUG, SESUG, PharmaSUG, and the SAS Global Forum.

Beginning her career at Rho as a Client Support Representative, Nichole has always enjoyed working with people, especially our clients. She excels at customer service and going the extra mile to ensure our clients' success and happiness, which is why she quickly transitioned into her current role as Associate Project Manager. Although Nichole is known to be social, sometimes she prefers collaborating on projects one-on-one with one colleague in particular---her husband Kamara, who is a Senior Clinical Data Associate at Rho. When they aren't working, Nichole and Kamara enjoy spending time with their son, Caleb.
